# Symmetry-dashboard

A personal home page dashboard in a form of a chrome extension.

Key features:
-Weather info once user accepts localisation permit,
-Displaying time and date
-Displaying images and inspirational quotes every time page is refreshed
-Displaying current value of paxos-gold asset in PLN currency and Bitcoin current price displayed in USD, along with 24h percentage change

Everything was done through public external API without need for private keys to not include backend to the project ( for keys safety )
